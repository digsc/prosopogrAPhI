This is a draft for an RESTful API for *prosopographical data*.

It should allow you to search for factoid modeled data on persons extracted from historical sources, and to update resources based on the model.
With "factoid" model we refer to Bradley/Short 2005.
See for an ontology of the factoid model: https://github.com/johnBradley501/FPO

Initiated by Georg Vogeler (Graz University, georg.vogler@uni-graz.at), but developed by the collective intelligence of the following bunch of people:

* Gunter Vasold (Univ. Graz)
* Thomas Wallnig (Univ. Vienna)
* Rainer Simon (AIT Vienna)
* (tbc)

Started in 2016

The major file in this is the swagger description of the proposed API ([prosopogrAPhI.yaml](https://github.com/GVogeler/prosopogrAPhI/blob/master/prosoprAPhI.yaml)). The [rationale.md](rationale.md) gives you some background to it.
